// This subsection groups all base abilities that are used in rolls. For example, Melee is used in conjunction with the skill necessary for the weapon of choice, like Blades
// Talents will receive XP from the Skill related to it. For each 10 XP, the Talent is leveled up, and one XP is sent to the smallest Attribute limiter. If all limiters are equal, than the player can choose to which Attribute send the XP.
