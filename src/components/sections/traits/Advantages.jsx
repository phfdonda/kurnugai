// This subsection holds the Advantages, special characteristics connected to a certain Attribute that will leverage the character to a different level.
// Each Advantage has its own properties that will affect gameplay. 
// Another way to get Advantages is to grab a Disadvantage of same level - although these can be chosen only during Character Build, or if the Narrator so allows.
// An Advantage (or Disadvantage) has five levels. The player cannot have an Advantage of level bigger than the related Attribute - but Disadvantages have no limit.
// A player with Dexterity 2, for example, can choose a Dexterity Disadvantage of 5 to be able to buy a Strength 5 Advantage - but the character must have Strength 5 to be able to do so.
